# Sudoku Solver

## Introduction

The Sudoku Solver is a Python-based program designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using efficient algorithms. This solver includes features for puzzle representation, input validation, and recursive solutions.

## Puzzle Representation

The Sudoku puzzle is represented as a 9x9 grid where each cell contains a digit from 1 to 9 or 0 to indicate an empty space.

## Extracting Rows, Columns, and Boxes

The program extracts rows, columns, and boxes from the Sudoku grid to facilitate various solving strategies.

## Sudoku Input Validations

The solver ensures that the input Sudoku puzzle is valid, adhering to the rules of Sudoku. It checks for repeated numbers in rows, columns, and boxes.

## Find Empty Position

The program includes a function to find an empty position (cell with value 0) in the Sudoku grid. This is a crucial step in the solving process.

## Complete/Solved Sudoku

When the solver successfully completes the Sudoku puzzle, it displays the solved grid, ensuring that all rows, columns, and boxes contain unique digits.

## Recursive Solution

The solver employs a recursive backtracking algorithm to explore and fill empty cells systematically until a valid solution is found.

## Solving Hundreds of Sudokus

This solver is not limited to a single puzzle. Its efficiency allows for the systematic solving of hundreds of Sudokus, making it a powerful tool for Sudoku enthusiasts and learners.
