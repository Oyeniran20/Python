## Overview

This project is designed to scrape information about GitHub Topics and their top repositories. It involves extracting data such as topic titles, descriptions, and repository details, including usernames, stars, and URLs. The scraped data is then organized and stored in CSV files for further analysis or exploration.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

  - This script contains functions for scraping information about GitHub Topics. It extracts topic titles, descriptions, and URLs, and stores the data in a Pandas DataFrame.

  - This script automates the scraping of top repositories for a specified GitHub topic. It utilizes functions from `scrape_topics.py` to obtain topic URLs and further scrapes repository information.

  - The script demonstrates the process of structuring and storing the scraped data. It includes steps for cleaning, transforming, and storing data in CSV files.

  - This script serves as a higher-level orchestrator that automates the scraping process for both the list of topics and the top repositories for each topic.
